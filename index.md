## Welcome to My Website

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jshokoor/jshokoor.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain communication and stay on top of updates that will be provided on a day to day basis.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

The easiest way to apply new edits and request future changes is the markdown method. Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jshokoor/jshokoor.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
